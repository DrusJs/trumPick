                                <p class="text c-text">"Often, we misunderstand the term 'balanced nutrition.' Most people genuinely try to adhere to dietary principles that they believe are correct.</p>

                                <p class="text c-text">However, current nutrition science, based on peer-reviewed articles, academic literature, human physiology, chemistry, and sociology, has formulated fundamental principles and approaches related to real criteria for balanced nutrition. These may differ from what an individual, including a scientist, doctor, author of popular books, and so on, may think about nutrition.</p>
                                
                                <p class="text c-text">For this reason, you might see an evaluation that differs from what you expected.</p>
                            
                                <p class="text c-text">TrumPick's main goal is to help you improve your health and preserve youthfulness. You will see these results through medical tests and subjective well-being. However, it's essential to be ready for a change in your daily diet. Initially, it might seem challenging. However, on days 20-60, when you observe clear positive results and get used to the new dietary style, it will become easy.</p>
                        
                                <p class="text c-text">balanced nutrition, as TrumPick suggests, consists of various ingredients and food groups that can be part of very delicious dishes. The main thing is your sincere and real desire to change your health and appearance for the better, not just pretending to make changes. In reality, it's a small effort leading to tremendous positive results.</p>
                    
                                <p class="text c-text">If, for social, cultural, or personal reasons, or due to a strong belief in certain arguments, you find it challenging to adhere to rational principles, you can use TrumPick 'for information' and situational application, meaning only executing those recommendations that personally suit you. This will also improve your well-being and reduce the risks of chronic diseases, even if not as significantly as following most of TrumPick's tips"</p>

                                <p class="text c-text">"Yes, proper nutrition can play a crucial role in managing disease risks, even with the overwhelming majority of genetic predispositions. Although genetics can influence your susceptibility to some diseases, the principles of balanced nutrition generally play a decisive role, with few exceptions. This is true even for many active chronic diseases, often reported as having genetic foundations, which can be brought into remission.</p>

                                <p class="text c-text">For instance, most cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis ('cholesterol plaques'), erectile dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, constipation, many types of cancer, and more, can be entirely preventable through nutrition. These diseases are the main causes of premature death, reduced comfort, and quality of life, and they consume significant resources for treatment.</p>
                                    
                                <p class="text c-text">Compounds present in food either stimulate the action of genes leading to diseases or suppress them, preventing the onset of these diseases.</p>
                                    
                                <p class="text c-text">Moreover, many diseases attributed to predominant genetic factors may not be truly genetic. They are often linked to dietary and lifestyle habits passed down from parents and grandparents, as well as prevailing habits in the society you live in. Changing behavior or being in the company of people with healthier habits can radically improve health, and diseases with presumed genetic predispositions may not develop.</p>
                                    
                                <p class="text c-text">You can try using TrumPick and see how your test results and well-being change after a couple of months. TrumPick recommendations are designed not to harm you. If you don't see a clear and distinct result, you can simply return to your old habits and only adopt what you like from TrumPick's advice.</p>
                                    
                                <p class="text c-text">In essence, if you are skeptical about the power of nutrition, start using TrumPick as an opportunity to try something new without additional investments. If this experience proves enjoyable over 2-3 months, you can incorporate it into your life"</p>

                                <p class="text c-text">Secondly, an assessment of products from peer-reviewed scientific journals.

                                <p class="text c-text">Indeed, products can vary in the content of specific compounds depending on geography and cultivation methods. Organic products generally have fewer harmful compounds on their surfaces.</p>
                                    
                                <p class="text c-text">However, to support growth, each product of a particular type has a set of similar compounds in its composition. That is, there are types and quantities of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, dietary fiber, etc., without which the product cannot reach maturity and dies at an early stage when it is not suitable for consumption. Some products contain more of these compounds, while others contain less. Some products may have additional types of compounds. TrumPick provides information about components that are consistently present in significant amounts in the product, based on data from at least 10 or more regions where these products are cultivated or caught, whether through conventional methods, organic farming methods (aquaculture), or growing in the wild.</p>
                                    
                                <p class="text c-text">Thus, TrumPick's information about the composition of whole foods is a minimal set of compounds that have a significant impact on humans when consumed.

The only difference is that at certain stages of pregnancy, an additional amount of food is required because there are two of you.

                                <p class="text c-text">"Global warming is an ongoing, long-term process of increasing temperatures on Earth. This creates favorable conditions for the emergence of global epidemics. As temperatures rise, bacteria, viruses, and fungi multiply more rapidly. Importantly, it increases their survivability at temperatures higher than that of the human body, making them more resistant to the body's immune response upon entry.</p>

                                <p class="text c-text">For instance, if fungi learn to survive at temperatures above 36°C (97°F), they could become deadly to humans without existing medications. Currently, these types of fungi do not pose a threat to humans as they are destroyed by the body's temperature. With the current pace of global warming, such survivability for fungi may be reached within the next 20-35 years.</p>
                                    
                                <p class="text c-text">The second issue associated with global warming is changes in the planet's water balance due to higher rates of evaporation of freshwater. As a result, soils lose fertility, and food becomes extremely expensive and less accessible.</p>
                                    
                                <p class="text c-text">Climate change occurs due to the Earth's temperature increase caused by the influence of greenhouse gases. The Earth absorbs sunlight and then radiates it as heat back into space. Greenhouse gases, including water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and ozone, are by-products of human and animal activities, including industrial and technological processes. These gases absorb the heat emitted by the Earth, slowing down its release into space. However, they do not impede the absorption of heat from a new batch of sunlight, leading to an overall increase in heat, and subsequently, a rise in Earth's temperature.</p>
                                    
                                <p class="text c-text">There is a well-defined statistical link between increased greenhouse gas emissions and the factors contributing to it. Generally, it is considered challenging to simultaneously slow down these emissions, given their connection to industries and transportation crucial for human quality of life. However, the food production sector, which is not essential for human well-being but increases the risk of diseases, is responsible for over 18% of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
                                    
                                <p class="text c-text">For example, the production of such food involves deforestation. Forests play a role in converting certain greenhouse gases into oxygen and prevent water loss. Without deforestation, increasing the production of such food is almost impossible due to a global shortage of suitable land. The popularity of such products is driven by marketing, leading to an increased demand.</p>
                                    
                                <p class="text c-text">If more than 1/5 of the global population follows TrumPick's daily dietary recommendations, it will lead to the cessation of global warming. If more than 1/3 follows these recommendations within 5-6 years, the temperature will gradually return to an acceptable level within 30-40 years. This transformation can happen without compromising the quality of life and income for the majority of the population.</p>
                                    
                                <p class="text c-text">This is likely the optimal strategy for humanity since avoiding such products will lead to a significant reduction in the burden of chronic and infectious diseases and the cessation of global warming. Thus, your contribution to your own health is also your personal contribution to a beautiful and clean future for the Earth, free from the impacts of global warming due to sensible human actions"</p>

For convenience, use the smart shopping list in the app. This helps ensure an adequate diet without delving into additional material about the product and its impact on health and skin.</p>

                                <p class="text c-text">If you're deciding whether to buy a specific product, you can input or photograph its composition. TrumPick in the upper left corner includes a prompt that helps you quickly decide whether to buy the product or find something else.</p>

You can find a direct replacement for the product, i.e., its direct analogue from a similar food group; a functional replacement, i.e., a better alternative in terms of impact on health and youthfulness; a culinary replacement, i.e., how to improve the properties of a familiar product during the cooking process by adjusting the main ingredient.</p>
                                    
                                <p class="text c-text">TrumPick also contains simple and quick recipes. Ingredients are collected from different food groups, helping to achieve an adequate daily diet. On the product analysis page, you can go to the recipes section and choose the recipes you prefer. Each recipe assumes the use of the product in the recommended TrumPick quantity. Also, the selection of recipes, already structured to ensure a balanced diet, is available in the 'Ideal Menu' tab on the 'Menu' page</p>
